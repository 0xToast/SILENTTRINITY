**---- READ THIS PLEASE ----**

By opening an issue, you are implicitly agreeing to the following rules & conditions: 
 
 1) If you're a dick your issue *will* get labled appropriately, I'll excercise my internet given right to comment with a potentially rude meme and I'll close it without any remorse.

 2) If your issue falls under the following categories it will be closed the NANOSECOND it's opened:

    - "X feature gets detected by X EDR/AV product"
        - This is not a bug. This is normal for an open source tool like this. If you try to solve it yourself and submit a PR I'll give you the `dank af` label as compensation which is legit street cred.
    
    - The classic yet under appreciated "please halp it no worky" issue
        - Opening an issue without any context, no error message output and implying that I should just drop everything that I'm doing and fix it right now. ðŸ–•

    - Opening an issue without filling out ALL of the information requested in the template below or just deleting it and opening the issue anyway.

    - Your issue isn't legible
        - Use Github formatting for pete's sake, If I go blind cause your issue looks like something that came out of freddy krueger's asshole I won't be able to fix anything and your issue will be labled appropriately.
